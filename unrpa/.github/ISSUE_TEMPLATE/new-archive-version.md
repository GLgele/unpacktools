## What did you try to open the archive with unrpa, and how did it fail?
Please copy and paste or screenshot the complete output from unrpa if it gave any.


### Files needed to add support
Where it is legal and possible to do so, please:
  - Provide the smallest possible archive that doesn't work.
  - Provide `renpy/loader.py`.
If you are unable to, please give us details on where we can find an example archive.
